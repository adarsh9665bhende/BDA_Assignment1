# Bayesian Inference Techniques Comparison

## Introduction

This repository contains code and a report for comparing two Bayesian inference techniques: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Variational Inference (VI). 

## Contents

- `Assignment1/`: Contains Jupyter Notebook implementing the Python programs in PyMC3 using MCMC and variational inference algorithms to learn posterior distribution over the parameters.
- `data/`: Contains sample data used for inference.
- `report/`: Contains a LaTeX report detailing the experimental setup, implementation details, results, and analysis.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.
- `posterior_dist_plot_VI.png`: Plot showing the posterior distribution obtained using VI.
- `posterior_dist_plot_MCMC.png`: Plot showing the posterior distribution obtained using MCMC.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- PyMC3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- LaTeX (for compiling the report)
